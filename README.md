hey warriors,
i have cloned booking.com here 
for now only frontend is but in future i will make full functional website with backend and admin
here details is given how you can know what i have created like routes etc...

there are three routes from which you can refer all the pages 
1st on '/' search you will see home page. 
2st on '/hotel' search you will see hotel booking page.
3st on '/list' search you will see lists of hotels page. 

also created date selection dropdown and adding no. of people dropdown in search-box

one more i forgot to tell that i only cloned hotel booking rather than all the services of booking.com
